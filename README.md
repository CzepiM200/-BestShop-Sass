# BestShop-Sass
BestShop-SASS is more complex website written in purpose to learn how to create complex layouts in CSS, HTML and JS with RWD. It is focused on positioning more elements, witch appears in simple and modern look. In SASS version I added calculator section and hamburger menu for devices with lower resolutions. In purpos of compiling SCSS to CSS I used Gulp. 

## Calculator
Calculator is implemented as a section. It allows user to choose package made for his own requirements. While choosing available options it dynamically changes list of services and total price. There is no need for clicking any button to get the results.

## RWD
Website is in written mobile first design. It scales properly for devices with higher and lower resolutions. This enables using the site on tablets and smartphones.
